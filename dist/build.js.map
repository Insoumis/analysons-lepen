La proportionnelle intégrale est ici dévoyée de son objectif premier. Il est en effet impossible d&#39;assurer la représentation de tous les français dans les élections lorsqu&#39;on commence par imposer un minimum de voix pour obtenir une représentation, les petits partis seraient évincés de ce parlement de la même manière qu&#39;aujourd&#39;hui.<br>Cela est encore plus accentué par la diminution proposée du nombre de représentants. Un nombre plus faible de députés implique mathématiquement que ces derniers représentent un plus grand nombre de français-e-s, et donc moins de représentativité.<br>De plus, la prime majoritaire de 30 % (rien que ça) d&#39;élus pour la liste arrivée en tête diminue encore le nombre de sièges effectivement réservés pour les députés élus par suffrage, et ferait qu&#39;en cas d&#39;éclatement des voix, un parti atteignant les 20 % de suffrages exprimés <a href=\\\"https://www.slate.fr/story/144942/marine-le-pen-presidente-proportionnelle-dissolution\\\">obtiendrait automatiquement la majorité</a>. Une manne donc pour le Front National, qui détient un quasi monopole sur son aile et serait à même d&#39;effectuer n&#39;importe quelle réforme.<br>Le référendum d’initiative populaire que M. Le Pen propose serait seulement législatif, c’est à dire que nous pourrions ajouter des lois et des articles de constitution, mais pas retirer ceux votés par le parlement, imposés par ordonnance ou par le 49.3. Il y a donc un risque non négligeable qu’il devienne un référendum uniquement consultatif (le gouvernement n&#39;aurait aucune obligation d&#39;adopter les propositions du référendum). Enfin, M.

Le principal responsable de la faible rémunération des producteurs est <a href=\\\"https://reporterre.net/Voici-comment-la-grande-distribution-ecrase-l-agriculture-en-France\\\">la grande distribution, qui écrase littéralement les producteurs</a>.

La proportionnelle intégrale est ici dévoyée de son objectif premier. Il est en effet impossible d&#39;assurer la représentation de tous les français dans les élections lorsqu&#39;on commence par imposer un minimum de voix pour obtenir une représentation, les petits partis seraient évincés de ce parlement de la même manière qu&#39;aujourd&#39;hui.<br>Cela est encore plus accentué par la diminution proposée du nombre de représentants. Un nombre plus faible de députés implique mathématiquement que ces derniers représentent un plus grand nombre de français-e-s, et donc moins de représentativité.<br>De plus, la prime majoritaire de 30 % (rien que ça) d&#39;élus pour la liste arrivée en tête diminue encore le nombre de sièges effectivement réservés pour les députés élus par suffrage, et ferait qu&#39;en cas d&#39;éclatement des voix, un parti atteignant les 20 % de suffrages exprimés <a href=\\\"https://www.slate.fr/story/144942/marine-le-pen-presidente-proportionnelle-dissolution\\\">obtiendrait automatiquement la majorité</a>. Une manne donc pour le Front National, qui détient un quasi monopole sur son aile et serait à même d&#39;effectuer n&#39;importe quelle réforme.<br>Le référendum d’initiative populaire que M. Le Pen propose serait seulement législatif, c’est à dire que nous pourrions ajouter des lois et des articles de constitution, mais pas retirer ceux votés par le parlement, imposés par ordonnance ou par le 49.3. Il y a donc un risque non négligeable qu’il devienne un référendum uniquement consultatif (le gouvernement n&#39;aurait aucune obligation d&#39;adopter les propositions du référendum). Enfin, M.

Le principal responsable de la faible rémunération des producteurs est <a href=\\\"https://reporterre.net/Voici-comment-la-grande-distribution-ecrase-l-agriculture-en-France\\\">la grande distribution, qui écrase littéralement les producteurs</a>.

entre le programme de la France Insoumise et celui du Front National ont été très nombreux et très virulents. Pourtant, <strong>aucune analyse sérieuse et critique des propositions de Marine Le Pen</strong> n'a été vraiment réalisée pour tenter de les confronter à celles portées par Jean-Luc Mélenchon.\n      <br>\n      <br>\n      Le Discord Insoumis propose donc une analyse des propositions du Front National à travers plusieurs thèmes. Cette analyse est bien évidemment très critique car le projet de société de Marine Le Pen est non seulement à l'opposé de celui de la France Insoumise mais il présente de nombreuses incohérences.\n      <br>\n      <br>\n      L'objectif de ce site est d'être <strong>une source de réflexion</strong> pour favoriser l'esprit critique de la population autour du projet mortifère du Front National.
